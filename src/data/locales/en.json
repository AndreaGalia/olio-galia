        "question": "How is your extra virgin oil produced?",

We use only mechanical processes without any chemical treatment, guaranteeing a 100% natural product.",

Always close the cap tightly after use and consume within 18 months of opening. Our dark bottles already protect the oil from light.",

        "question": "Is the oil really produced in Sicily?",
        "answer": "Absolutely yes. Our olive groves are located in the Sicilian hills where our grandfather planted the first trees in 1950. Every phase of production takes place on site: from cultivation to harvesting, from milling to bottling. We are proud of our 100% Sicilian origin.",

      {
        "question": "What certifications does your oil have?",
