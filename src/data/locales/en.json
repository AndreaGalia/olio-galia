        "question": "How is your extra virgin oil produced?",

Olives are strictly hand-picked at the right degree of ripeness, then cold-milled within 24 hours of harvest. We use only mechanical processes without any chemical treatment, guaranteeing a 100% natural product.",

        "question": "What is the difference between your oils?",
        "answer": "We offer three types: Classic Oil with intense fruity and fresh grass notes, certified Organic Oil with delicate flavor and balanced spicy aftertaste, and Premium Oil from century-old olives with complex organoleptic profile. Each oil has unique characteristics suitable for different palates and uses.",
        "category": "products"
      },
      {
        "question": "How to best store extra virgin oil?",
        "answer": "To keep the organoleptic properties intact, store the oil in a cool and dry place, away from light and heat sources. The ideal temperature is between 14-18°C. Always close the cap tightly after use and consume within 18 months of opening. Our dark bottles already protect the oil from light.",

        "question": "Do you ship throughout Italy?",
        "answer": "Yes, we ship throughout Italy with express courier. For orders over €50, shipping is free. We use special packaging to protect bottles during transport. Delivery times are generally 2-3 working days. For international orders, contact us for specific information.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is the oil really produced in Sicily?",
        "answer": "Absolutely yes. Our olive groves are located in the Sicilian hills where our grandfather planted the first trees in 1940. Every phase of production takes place on site: from cultivation to harvesting, from milling to bottling. We are proud of our 100% Sicilian origin.",
        "category": "origin"
      },
      {
        "question": "What certifications does your oil have?",
        "answer": "Our oils are DOP (Protected Designation of Origin) certified and comply with all Italian and European quality standards.
